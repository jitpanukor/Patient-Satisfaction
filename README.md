# Patient Satisfaction Project

This project analyzes patient satisfaction in hospitals across the United States using HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey data. The goal is to evaluate how hospitals perform based on patient ratings and satisfaction scores. 
By leveraging SQL for data cleaning and preparation and creating a visually insightful Tableau dashboard, this project provides a comprehensive view of patient satisfaction metrics, helping stakeholders identify areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement.
